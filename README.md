# Digital Image Processing

This is the digital image processing course projects of SJTU.

## Data

`BMP_images` : Some classic grayscale images in digital image processing. The image files' format is bmp.

## Project1

`project1/main.m`: use DFT/IDFT, low-pass filtering and high-pass filtering

`project1/main2.m`: use DCT/IDCT, low-pass filtering and high-pass filtering

`project2/results`ï¼š

- `lena.png`: raw figure
- `lena.gaussian.png`: the image processed by gaussian filtering
- `lena_high_pass_filtering.png`: the image processed by high-pasa filtering
- `lena_homomorphic.png`: the image processed by homomorphic filtering
- `lena_low_pass_filtering.png`: the image processed by low-pass filtering
- `lena_mean_filter.png`: the image processed by mean filtering
